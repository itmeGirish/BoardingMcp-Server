Sir/Madam,

Under the instructions from and on behalf of my client, {{LENDER_NAME}} (hereinafter referred to as "the Noticee"), I do hereby serve upon you this Legal Notice and state as follows:

1. That my client is a law-abiding citizen residing at {{LENDER_ADDRESS}}, Bengaluru, Karnataka, and is well known to you personally.

2. That you approached my client on or about {{LOAN_DATE}} and requested for a hand loan of ₹8,50,000/- (Rupees Eight Lakhs Fifty Thousand Only) citing urgent personal/financial necessity. You made solemn assurances and promises that you would repay the entire amount within a period of {{REPAYMENT_PERIOD}} from the date of advancement of the loan.

That based on the trust and confidence reposed in you and relying upon your verbal assurances, my client advanced a sum of ₹8,50,000/- (Rupees Eight Lakhs Fifty Thousand Only) to you by way of electronic bank transfer on {{TRANSFER_DATE}} from my client's bank account maintained at {{LENDER_BANK_NAME}}, Account No. {{LENDER_ACCOUNT_NUMBER}} to your bank account maintained at {{BORROWER_BANK_NAME}}, Account No. {{BORROWER_ACCOUNT_NUMBER}}, bearing UTR/Transaction Reference No. {{TRANSACTION_REFERENCE}}.

4. That the said bank transfer statement/receipt is in the possession of my client and shall serve as conclusive proof of the said transaction and advancement of the loan amount.

5. That although no written loan agreement was executed between the parties, the bank transfer records, electronic communications, and the relationship of trust between the parties clearly establish the existence of the hand loan and the obligation on your part to repay the same.

6. That despite the expiry of the agreed repayment period and despite several verbal and telephonic reminders and demands made by my client, you have wilfully, deliberately, and without any justifiable reason failed, neglected, and refused to repay the loan amount of ₹8,50,000/- or any part thereof to my client.

7. That your failure to repay the said amount despite repeated demands amounts to:
   (a) Civil breach of the obligation to repay a debt;
   (b) Criminal breach of trust punishable under Section 405 read with Section 406 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 (erstwhile Section 405/406 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860);
   (c) Cheating punishable under Section 318 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 (erstwhile Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860);
   (d) Dishonest misappropriation of property under the applicable provisions of law.

8. That my client is entitled to claim interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the principal amount of ₹8,50,000/- from the date of advancement of the loan, i.e., {{LOAN_DATE}}, till the date of actual realization. The accrued interest as on the date of this notice is approximately ₹{{ACCRUED_INTEREST}}/-.
